# Hotel-Cancellation-Forecast-Assistant
Predict cancellations before they happen and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or incentives, to reduce revenue loss.

In this project I created a Multy-Agent Assistant that has a User-Friendly Interface, built with Streamlit ,customizable LangGraph workflow, it has seamless Data integration, it's Scalable and Efficient!
Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning Agent
Automatically cleans and preprocesses raw booking data.
2. Machine Learning Agent:
Utilizes XGBoost with Optuna hyperparameter tuning to deliver the best-performing model.
3. Predictive Analytics:
Generates cancellation probabilities for each booking, helping you identify high-risk reservations.
4. Interactive Dashboard:
Upload and visualize your data in real-time.
Train the model and view performance metrics directly in the app.
Download predictions for further analysis or integration with your CRM system.

How It Works:
Upload Your Data:
Simply upload your hotel booking data in CSV format. The assistant handles the rest.

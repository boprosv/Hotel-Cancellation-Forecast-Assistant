# Hotel-Cancellation-Forecast-Assistant
Predict cancellations before they happen and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or incentives, to reduce revenue loss.

In this project, I created a Multi-Agent Assistant with a User-Friendly Interface built using Streamlit. It features a customizable LangGraph workflow, seamless data integration, and is both scalable and efficient. While the full process typically includes data exploration and various other steps, my focus here is on probability predictions.This system could have been fully automated, but I prefer to keep my finger on the pulse and monitor every step to ensure precision and control.

Key Features:
1. Data Cleaning Agent
Automatically cleans and preprocesses raw booking data.
2. Machine Learning Agent:
Utilizes XGBoost with Optuna hyperparameter tuning to deliver the best-performing model.
3. Predictive Analytics:
Generates cancellation probabilities for each booking, helping you identify high-risk reservations.
4. Interactive Dashboard:
Upload and visualize your data in real-time.
Train the model and view performance metrics directly in the app.
Download predictions for further analysis or integration with your CRM system.

How It Works:
Upload Your Data:
Simply upload your hotel booking data in CSV format. The assistant handles the rest.
Here is the glips of the Data:
